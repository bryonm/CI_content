<h2>ABOUT OUR CATALOG</h2>
<p>Cross International&rsquo;s Christmas Catalog offers extraordinary gift giving opportunities during the Christmas season. So many traditional Christmas presents focus on wants rather than needs, and very few gifts have a profound impact as a result. With this catalog, we hope to offer compassionate Christians like you better options. <br />
<br />
This catalog brings you the unique Christmas outreaches that share the love of Jesus through gifts that glorify Him and serve the poorest of the poor. While some items in our catalog may seem simple, each one represents a tremendous blessing for the poor.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 0;">HONOR A LOVED ONE WITH YOUR GIFT </h2>
<p>You can also share your faith and honor loved ones with your choice of gifts! When you sponsor projects or outreaches on behalf of friends or loved ones, you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to notify them about the gift made on their behalf by sending an e-card or by printing out a certificate to hand deliver. <br />
<br />
Make giving profound, God-honoring Christmas presents part of your family tradition and honor the ones you love by sending a gift that will change someone&rsquo;s life forever! </p>

<p><em>Our Promise to You &ndash; Proceeds from this campaign will be used to cover any expenditures for the Christmas Catalog incurred through June 30, 2018, the close of our ministry&rsquo;s new fi scal year. In the event that more funds are raised than needed to fully fund the project, the excess funds, if any, will be used to meet the most urgent needs of the ministry.
