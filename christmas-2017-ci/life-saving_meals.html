<p>As you look forward to holiday treats and feasts, please remember the hungry by giving the gift of Vitafood. <br />
<br />
Vitafood is a nutrient-rich meal, scientifically designed to meet the unique needs of starving children. These life-saving meals are sealed in an airtight pouch to maximize shelf-life and fit as many as possible in a shipping container. Your support will send these donated meals to our overseas Christian ministry partners, so they can fight malnutrition and feed hungry mouths in schools, orphanages, nutrition centers and other crucial programs. <br />
<br />
Vitafood is also the perfect solution for urgent and emergency situations, when supplies must be acquired and delivered quickly to families in need. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Just $35 can send enough Vitafood to feed a family for a whole month!</em></span> <br />
<br />
Donate and help fight hunger while reaching the poor with the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

<p><em>Proceeds from this campaign will be used to cover any expenditures for Christmas Catalog Life-Saving Meals incurred through June 30, 2018, the close of our ministry&rsquo;s new fiscal year. In the event that more funds are raised than needed to fully fund the project, the excess funds, if any, will be used to meet the most urgent needs of the ministry.
