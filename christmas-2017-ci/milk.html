<h1>
    MILK FOR NEWBORNS</h1>
    <div class="project_box_row">
    <div class="project_box_row_text">
    <p>In developing countries, milk is only available to a small percentage of the population. As a result, the poor are deprived of the nutrition they need. <br />
    <br />
    Whole milk contains essential fats and vitamins, such as vitamins A and D, which are vital to brain and nerve development in small children. Without that resource, many children are in danger of suffering stunted growth, but this gift provides a solution! <br />
    <br />
    You can enrich a child&rsquo;s diet by sending the gift of whole milk to the poor who desperately need it. <br />
    <br />
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>A gift of just $10 can send 100 bottles of milk, and $100 can send 1,000 bottles!</em></span> This product is easily shipped, needs no refrigeration, and can be safely stored for six months. <br />
    <br />
    Join us today and be Christ&rsquo;s hands and feet to a family in need by helping them nourish their hungry children!</p>

    <p><em>Proceeds from this campaign will be used to cover any expenditures for Christmas Catalog Milk incurred through June 30, 2018, the close of our ministry&rsquo;s new fiscal year. In the event that more funds are raised than needed to fully fund the project, the excess funds, if any, will be used to meet the most urgent needs of the ministry.</em></p>
