<h1>AID THE ORPHAN</h1>
<div class="project_box_row">
<div class="project_box_row_text">
<p>Every night millions of orphan children around the world go to sleep without a mommy or a daddy. These precious little ones have lost one or both parents to the world wide AIDS pandemic or another illness or tragedy. <br />
<br />
This loss leaves orphan-children with a lack of security, loving parents, a safe home, or daily meals, but you can help change that. <br />
<br />
We partner with pastors and missionaries who care for orphans and vulnerable children around the world. Your gift will not only allow them to better care for the physical needs of these orphaned children, but it will also help empower their spiritual outreaches as well. <br />
<br />
Through this ministry, you can let struggling children know that Jesus loves them and he will never leave or forsake them. Your gift will extend Christ&rsquo;s arms to feed, clothe, shelter, educate and hug needy children. <br />
<br />
Be God&rsquo;s hands and feet, and reach out to orphan children this Christmas. They need you now more than ever!</p>

<p><em>Proceeds from this campaign will be used to cover any expenditures for Christmas Catalog Orphans and Vulnerable Children incurred through June 30, 2018, the close of our ministry&rsquo;s new fiscal year. In the event that more funds are raised than needed to fully fund the project, the excess funds, if any, will be used to meet the most urgent needs of the ministry.</em></p>
